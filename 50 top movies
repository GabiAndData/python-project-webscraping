# You now need to write the loop to extract the appropriate information from the web page. The rows of the table needed can be accessed using the find_all() function with the BeautifulSoup object using the statements below.

# You can now iterate over the rows to find the required data. Use the code shown below to extract the information.

# The code functions as follows.

# Iterate over the contents of the variable rows.
# Check for the loop counter to restrict to 50 entries.
# Extract all the td data objects in the row and save them to col.
# Check if the length of col is 0, that is, if there is no data in a current row. This is important since, many times there are merged rows that are not apparent in the web page appearance.
# Create a dictionary data_dict with the keys same as the columns of the dataframe created for recording the output earlier and corresponding values from the first three headers of data.
# Convert the dictionary to a dataframe and concatenate it with the existing one. This way, the data keeps getting appended to the dataframe with every iteration of the loop.
# Increment the loop counter.
# Once the counter hits 50, stop iterating over rows and break the loop.

# After the dataframe has been created, you can save it to a CSV file (Remember that you defined the variable csv_path earlier) using the following command:
df.to_csv(csv_path)

# To store the required data in a database, you first need to initialize a connection to the database, save the dataframe as a table, and then close the connection. This can be done using the following code:
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
df.to_sql(table_name, conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
conn.close()
